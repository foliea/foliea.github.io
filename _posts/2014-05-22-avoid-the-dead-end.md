title: Avoid the dead end
---

I have been working as a .NET developer for two years in Paris, but I started programming in 2008. 
Despite that, I feel that I still have a lot to learn. 
In my current work, I am working mostly with old technologies. 
I am also working alone, with just a product manager who verify that we are focussing on business needs. 
I don't have time to make things in the best way I can. 
Iterations are really quick and business guys of the company are pressuring me to deliver their 
needs faster than it's humanly possible to do it properly. 

I am working a lot more at home to keep learning things and compensate. I am really passionnate about programming and code quality.
I am working hard on a few side projects. I learnt Ruby and Rails in a few months (thanks to [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/))
and I am also trainning on a few katas on [Codewars](http://www.codewars.com/) to improve my skills.

But there is still one problem: I am on my own. I attended a few meetups to talk with other passionate developers, and
share knowledge. But this is not enough. It would be so nice to receive feedback on what I am 
doing (good or wrong), sharing my passion every day with great people. 

Meanwhile, I am going to be a mentor for the first time at the next [RailsGirls](http://railsgirls.com/paris) in Paris this week end. I
am a bit nervous, I will try to do my best. See you there for those who are coming!
